# Model Accuracy Evaluation: AusOpen 2026 Qualifiers (Full)

**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Matches Evaluated:** 48
**Accuracy:** **47.92%** (23/48 Matches Correctly Predicted)

## Summary
The model was evaluated against a comprehensive set of **48 qualification matches** played on January 14 and 15, 2026. This includes both the Second Round and Final Round of qualifying.

- **Correct Predictions:** 23
- **Incorrect Predictions:** 25
- **Accuracy Drop:** The accuracy dropped significantly from the initial subset (64%) to 48% when evaluating the full field. This suggests the model struggles with the high variance and lower-ranked matchups typical of qualifying rounds.

## Detailed Results (Selected)

The model correctly predicted 23 matches but failed on 25. Below are some notable examples.

### ❌ False Positives (High Confidence Errors)
The model was confident (>70%) but the predicted winner lost.

| Match | Predicted Winner | Actual Winner | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dane Sweeny** vs Jerome Kym | Jerome Kym | Dane Sweeny | 80.05% |
| **Gilles Bailly** vs R. Carballes Baena | R. Carballes Baena | Gilles Bailly | 77.60% |
| **George Loffhagen** vs Y. Nishioka | Y. Nishioka | George Loffhagen | 78.45% |
| **Stefano Travaglia** vs M. Landaluce | Martin Landaluce | Stefano Travaglia | 70.82% |
| **Francesco Maestrelli** vs T. Seyboth Wild | T. Seyboth Wild | F. Maestrelli | 69.31% |

### ✅ Correct Predictions (High Confidence)
| Match | Predicted Winner | Actual Winner | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Yibing Wu** vs Nicolas Mejia | Yibing Wu | Yibing Wu | 79.23% |
| **Rei Sakamoto** vs Connor Smith | Rei Sakamoto | Rei Sakamoto | 72.64% |

## Analysis
1.  **Underdog Victories:** The qualifying rounds saw significant upsets where lower-rated players (or those with lower model scores) defeated established names like Yoshihito Nishioka, Roberto Carballes Baena, and Thiago Seyboth Wild. The model heavily favored these established players (70-80% confidence) and was wrong.
2.  **Dane Sweeny Factor:** Dane Sweeny continues to defy the model, winning against Jerome Kym despite an 80% probability against him.
3.  **Data Quality:** Qualifying matches often involve players with sparse recent ATP data, forcing the model to rely on older history or imputed stats, which reduces accuracy.

## Methodology
- **Data Source:** Match results were extracted directly from Flashscore using a browser agent.
- **Evaluation:** The model (XGBoost) was trained on historical data up to 2025 and predictions were generated dynamically for the 48 matches.
